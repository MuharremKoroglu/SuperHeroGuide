## <h2> About This App <img src = "https://c.tenor.com/JsoERRQcZqYAAAAi/thumbs-up-joypixels.gif" width = "42"></h2>
This app is a superhero guide. It shows developers how to use the alamofire package, as well as custom formats and how to animate them. The application was prepared by the MVVM structure. First, we created our model. We used the quicktype.io website while creating the model. In this way, our model was prepared quickly and accurately. Then we wrote our service. Here we took advantage of the Alamofire package. Alamofire is a package that helps us with many tools it provides in transactions with the internet. We requested with the request method of the Alamofire package. We gave our model to the responseDecodable method for the subsequent data to be resolved. Then we received the data that came with the closure given to us. We handled the returned errors and data using the result method of the incoming data. We created a callback with @escaping. In this way, we sent the incoming data to the ViewModel. Also here we created a base URL and created the URL paths of the superheroes with an enum. In this way, security is ensured by not dealing with any string on the front. The View Model is inherited from the ObservableObject class. In addition, every data was @Published and the View was informed. We also got our data by running our internet service here. In View, we first created the objects of the superheroes we want to receive with @ObservedObject. In this way, we can listen to the incoming data. Then we used a ScrollView that provides scrolling on the main screen and NavigationStack that provides navigation. We've created a slightly more manageable code structure by dividing certain repetitive operations into separate structures. The superhero clicked here is sent to the detail page. Here you can access all the information about the superhero. The most important point on the detail page is the circular bars we prepared ourselves. In this way, we show the incoming data to the user more aesthetically and understandably. We used the Shape class when designing them. Then we made it compatible with the animation. Here we created the circular shape in the path function. We gave information about the shape with the arc method. Then we used it with a Text to print both the shape we created and the percentage values obtained in the View. Here we take a lot of data where it is used so that the view is customizable. In this way, it becomes a shape that fits everywhere. In addition, we make it even more beautiful by giving an animation. Finally, we've improved many code blocks to make them more readable and understandable.
